In Iranian law, being in prison is one of the circumstances under which absence from military service is permitted.\r\n\r\nSama Nourani was accepted for a course in medical engineering at Sahand University in Tabriz in October 2008, but was expelled after three semesters because of his Bahai beliefs. At that time, his name was sent to the authorities responsible for granting exemption from military service. He was arrested on March 2, 2010, along with Navid Khanjani and Iqan Shahidi.",

It is also notable Khanjani was dismissed from the Isfahan Industrial Management Organization where he was a student. His dismissal was due to the fact that he was Bahá’í. ",

Last year he completed the necessary entrance exams for a course in electrical engineering, but the university officials refuse to enroll him because he is regarded as absent without leave from military service. In Iranian law, being in prison is one of the circumstances under which absence from military service is permitted. \r\n\r\nSama Nourani was accepted for a course in medical engineering at Sahand University in Tabriz in October 2008, but was expelled after three semesters because of his Bahai beliefs. At that time, his name was sent to the authorities responsible for granting exemption from military service. He was arrested on March 2, 2010, along with Navid Khanjani and Iqan Shahidi. ",

His torturers burned him with cigarettes, used thorns, and hung him upside down and abused and beat him. No judicial documents (such as a detention order) were shown to him. [Since he has been summoned to Evin prison, not to a court, it appears that his abduction and torture was in fact a trial, and he has been sentenced as a result ~ Sen]",
