He is a student of theoretical physics, and had successfully completed a Bachelor’s degree at Isfahan University. Because of his high grades, he was admitted to the Master’s course in fundamental physics without having to take the admissions examination. At the time he was told that he had been expelled, he had completed all the requirements for a Master’s degree except for his dissertation. He was allowed 10 days to lodge an objection [which he has done], but has not received any reply. An unusual aspect of this expulsions is that the University of Isfahan originally sent him a letter of disenrollment two years ago, and after that, accepted his enrollment [in the Master's course].",

The security forces were accompanied by a film crew. After six months, their detention without trial has been extended. They are charged with propaganda against the regime in favour of oppositional organizations and groups; spying for the benefit of foreigners; promoting deviant Baha’i ideas; supporting the apostasy of a large number of Muslims; and blasphemy against Islam. During their six months detention, Bakhtiyar Rasekhi spent 45 days in solitary confinement, and Farhnaz Na`imi and Farin Rahimi spent 35 days in the quarantine facility where conditions are poor [these rooms are intended for short stays and do not have hygiene or sleeping facilities]. Farhnaz Na`imi became ill during her detention, but prison authorities did not allow her to be treated. On February 14, Farhnaz and Farin were transferred to the women’s wing of Kerman prison, and in May, Bakhtiyar Rasekhi was transferred to the general detention block at the prison. The efforts of their family to arrange for release on bail have been fruitless. Every two months, the Ministry of Intelligence extends their detention without trial.",

Members of the security forces, bearing a hand-written and invalid warrant, searched his home and arrested him. His wife, Taraneh Torabi ( ترانه ترابی ) is 7 months pregnant, and was herself detained and interrogated for 21 days in February 2011, and eventually sentenced to 5 years and 10 months in prison.\r\n\r\nBetween 24 and 29 December 2011, Erfan Ehsani was summoned several times to the offices of the Ministry of Intelligence, by telephone. His request to the authorities for a written and valid summons was answered with insults to himself and his family. His complaint about the invalid procedure, addressed to the court in Semnan, was rejected by the court which endorsed the verbal summons. When he responded to the summons, he was arrested, on 31 December 2011. [The report does not indicate how long he was detained on that occasion.]",

Following persistent enquiries from her husband, he was told that she was accused of acting against national security and propaganda against the regime. Further inquiries about the duration of her detention remained unanswered. It was eventually discovered that she is being held in the general wing of Qaemshahr prison.\r\n\r\nShahnaz Zanjebur’s home was searched on July 30, when agents from the Ministry of Intelligence seized all the Baha'i books and images as well as cassettes and CDs. She was previously arrested in June, 2010, and was held in solitary confinement in the Sari jail for three weeks, before being fined 400,000 tumans. On that occasion the charges were acting against national security and cooperating with Shirin Ebadi.",

	"description": "Shahram Mokhtari ( شهرام مختاری ), a Bahai from Birjand (South Khorasan) was arrested on April 24. He was held in temporary detention by the Ministry of Intelligence in Birjand for one month, and then transferred to the quarantine wing in Birjand prison. His family has still had no clear indication from officials of what charges he may face. Initially it was said that the reasons for his arrest were a complaint laid against him by another individual, and teaching the Bahai Faith. Later the main charge was said to be “propaganda against the regime,” and more recently his wife has been told that the original complaint was one laid by the Ministry of Intelligence. The quarantine wing of the prison is one normally used to hold prisoners for up to 48 hours before they enter the general wing of the prison. It has no sanitation facilities, and no provision for eating and sleeping. Another Bahai, the 85-year-old Muhammad Hussein Nakh`i ( محمد حسین نخعی ), is being held in the general wing of the same prison.\r\n\r\nUpdate, June 6: HRANA reports that Mr. Mohktari is still being held in the quarantine wing. He has now spent more than one month living in a space that is not designed for long-term detention, since it has no sleeping, washing or eating facilities.",

	"description": "Rozita Vatheqi ( رزیتا واثقی ), a Bahai serving a 5-year sentence in Vakil Abad prison in Mashhad, is still being denied leave from prison, although she has served two years and nine months of her sentence. Prison officials have approved the leave, but the Ministry of Intelligence is preventing it being granted. By law, she should be eligible for parole after serving half her sentence, and leave from prison is normally granted earlier. Her old and ill mother, who has also been imprisoned, has been granted leave [or parole, the text is not clear ~Sen].\r\n\r\nShe was arrested at her home in Mashhad by the Ministry of Intelligence on March 14, 2010. After her arrest she was held for 12 days in quarantine before being transferred to the Ministry of Intelligence’s private jail, where she was held in solitary confinement for more than six months. She was interrogated for more than two months during this confinement. On April 25, 2010, she was transferred to solitary confinement in Mashhad’s central prison. During this period she only met her family once. On June 26, 2010, bail of 50 million tumans was set and paid by her family, but not only was she not freed, the authorities did not give her family any clear and adequate explanation. Her health deteriorated because of the poor conditions during this long period. Finally, on December 20, 2010, she was tried in the Revolutionary Court, along with 3 other Bahais, on charges of propagating the Bahai Faith and blasphemy. The trial was behind closed doors, and the judge did not permit a defence, or allow the accused to speak. She was sentenced to 5 years in prison, which was confirmed by the court of review, and she was then transferred to Vakil Abad prison near Mashhad to serve her sentence. The officials at this prison have made conditions for female prisoners of conscience especially harsh, by limiting their visitation rights and telephone calls, and the time allowed outdoors for exercise. They are not permitted to use the library. On June 29, 2011, Rozita Vatheqi was again tried, on a charge of teaching the Bahai Faith. Reports do not indicate what sentence was imposed.",

	"description": "It was previously reported that security forces raided the home and optician’s shop of Mr. Akbar Por-hoseini (اکبر پورحسینی) in Semnan, and took his entire stock. He was arrested, along with Afrasiyab Subhani ( افراسیاب سبحانی ), and was later released on bail. The court has now sentenced him to a fine of 3.6 billion Rials (225,000 euro, 293,000 US dollars) and the confiscation of all his stock, for not having a “green card” (permitting the entry of goods through customs). [This is curious, as green cards are required for importers, to obtain the release of the goods at customs. It is not clear why the authorities would expect a retailer to have such a card ~ Sen]\r\n",

	"description": "Zahra Nik-A’in and Taraneh Torabi, two Bahai mothers who have previously been sentenced to 24 and 20 months in prison, respectively, have been summoned to Semnan prison to begin serving their sentences, although both are breast-feeding infants. Zahra Nik-A’in was one of six Bahais arrested in Semnan on March 11 and 12, 2011, and released on an exceptionally bail on April 3.\r\n\r\nZahra’s child Rosam ( رسام ) is 5 months old, and Taraneh’s child Barman ( بارمان ) (pictured) was born one month prematurely, and is now just one month old. Given the limited space, and the lack of washing and feeding facilities in the prison, it is not a suitable place for caring for children. It is not clear what the children’s fate will be. The situation for Taraneh Torabi is particularly serious, because her husband `Erfan Ehsani ( عرفان احسانی ) was arrested during the last months of her pregnancy, and has just been sentenced to one year in prison, and this along with the searches of their home and insulting behaviour of officials has not been good for her physical and mental condition.",

They are banned from visitations and are not allowed to contact their families. Even though their families delivered their medications, the prisoners did not receive them due to the prison infirmary being closed. These conditions are especially dangerous for Vehdat Dana who is suffering from heart disease.\r\n\r\nBranch 1 of the Shiraz Revolutionary Court handed down a 10-month prison sentence to these 4 Baha’i citizens on March 1, 2010 on the charge of “propaganda against the regime.” The sentencing was upheld at the Shiraz appellate court in August 2011. They were arrested in early December 2011 and transferred to Pirbenoy prison in Shiraz to serve their sentences behind bars.\r\n",

	"description": "Recently officials of the Ministry of Information in Tabriz summoned Mr. Mithaqi (میثاقی ) and his wife for interrogation. Mr. Mithaqi is the son of Mr. Allahvardi Mithaqi (الله وردی میثاقی), who was executed in 1981 on charges of being a Bahá'í. After discussing community activities, the officials said that putting flowers on the graves of [Bahá'í] martyrs was considered a form of propaganda, and asked him not to lay flowers on the grave of his father and not to maintain the grave stone. The couple refused to comply, saying that the request was improper.\r\nMr. Allahvardi Mithaqi was an educator, and a member of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Tabriz. He was married, and had five children. He was executed on July 29, 1981.\r\n\r\nLINK:\r\nhttp://networkedblogs.com/qNXLL",

	"description": "As previously reported here, on October 17, security agents arrested 18 Bahais in Golestan Province, in the North of Iran, most of the them in the city of Gorgan, and at least one other Bahai is known to have been arrested in Gorgan since then. Now HRANA reports that since then, there has been a wave of arrests of Muslims in the city of Gorgan who might have been in contact with Bahais.\r\n\r\nThe arrests began on October 17, when four people were arrested in their homes and taken for interrogation. One of these was released on the same day after signing a written promise not to have any contact with Bahais. Two others were released after one week, and one is still in detention in the Ministry of Intelligence’s facilities. On October 23, two more people were arrested in Gorgan, on the charge of having contact with Bahais, only to be released later that day. One of them is reported to have been severely beaten and abused during the interrogation. Next day, another person was summoned to the Ministry of Intelligence, and there has been no news of him or her since. On October 25, another person received a telephone summons. The charge against one of the detainees is said to be “propaganda against the regime.” It is likely that more Muslims have been detained in Gorgan in the same way, but sources of information on the security situation in Gorgan are limited.",

Agents from the Ministry of Intelligence searched her home and seized a computer, printer, and religious books and images. They had a search warrant, and wrote in the word “arrest” themselves. The warrant was in any case invalid, since it did not bear the letterhead of a court, and was not signed by a judge. It is notable that `Abas Alizadeh ( عباس علیزاده ), a Ministry of Intelligence interrogator specialising in Bahai matters, was present during the raid. When Shirin Foroughiyan persisted in demanding a valid warrant, he threatened to beat her harder. Shirin Foroughiyan and her husband `Adel Samimi ( عادل صمیمی ) were arrested previously, in the winter of 2008, when they were fined 300,000 tumans each (about 210 euros, 300 USD).",

In the context of a discussion of Egypt’s changing education policy, one question affirmed the long-standing legacy of marginalized minority religions such as the Baha’i faith across Egyptian society. The newspaper asked, “What is the position of the ministry regarding the right of Baha’is to enroll their children in school?” His response was: “State law in accordance with government procedures only recognizes three religions, and the Baha’i faith is not among them. Thus their children do not have the right to register in government schools.”",

	"description": "Bahais in the village of Kata, in the province of Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, have been unable to engage in work on their farms because of actions of government officials. Farms have also been confiscated, and Bahais have not been allowed to care for the crops growing on their farms. In the past 30 years, this community of several thousand Bahais has been subjected to government-orchestrated attacks. These attacks have intensified in recent years, including beatings, the looting of property, property confiscations, and imprisonment. Court summons, and in some cases imprisonment, have been used to force the Bahais to sell their land and leave the area. Resistance to the forced sales has led only to increased pressure. In the past year, all the land of the Bahais has been confiscated, except for one acre (0.4 hectares) allowed per Bahai family, for subsistence farming. In recent months, groups of local people organised at the local level have been making daily home visits to the Bahais to recite anti-Bahai slogans. In recent days the slogan-shouting has escalated to entering and looting the homes of the Bahais, to the extent that they are now left without the basic means of subsistence. On June 25, when a number of Bahai farmers were working in their fields, police arrived with a court warrant allowing the seizure of possessions and properties belonging to Bahais, and arrested a number of the Bahai farmers. Government officials also required all tractor owners in the area to promise not to plough land for Bahais.\r\n\r\nWitnesses and local people have said that the confiscation of land occurs each year at the initiative of an Executive Committee, and every year, during the harvest, government officials arrive with order to seize farmland. This Executive Committee is one of the quasi-government bodies which answers to the Supreme Leader, not to the government. They control a large part of the economy and are effectively above the law.",

	"description": "On December 2, security forces arrested Behzad Dhabihi, Anvar Moslemi and Eshkan Zamani ( بهزاد ذبیحی، انور مسلمی و اشکان زمانی ) in Sari. After 48 hours in detention, they have been charged and their immediate transfer to Mashhad has been authorised. More details of the arrests have also emerged. On the morning of December 2, agents from the Ministry of Intelligence went to the workplace of Behzad Dhabihi, and then took him to his home, which they searched, before arresting him. On the same day they went to the home of Anvar Moslemi. As he was not at home, his wife refused to open the door to unknown people. The agents forced entry by climbing a wall, and searched the house while uttering blasphemies. Finally, at 5 p.m., they left a summons for Mr Moslemi. At about noon, agents went to the home of Mr. Zamani, and when he came home from work at 2 p.m., beat him up in front of his wife and two-year-old child, handcuffed him and arrested him.\r\n\r\nThe charge the three will face in Mashhad is “propaganda against the regime, in favour of the Bahai Faith.” The warrant for the searches and arrest did not bear the letterhead of the judicial authorities, and had the names of the three detainees added by hand. The court official whose name and seal was on the document has denied any knowledge of it.\r\n\r\nMr. Zamani suffers from a heart condition and has to take medicine every day. Although he took his medication with him when he was arrested, the officers would not allow him to have them for the first 24 hours of his detention. Mr. Dhabihi has a peptic ulcer, for which he was being treated, and Mr. Moslemi has a lung condition.\r\n\r\nBehzad Dhabihi has been arrested twice previously, in March 2011 and April 2012, on charges of propaganda against the regime. On the first occasion he was held for 72 hours in Sari, and on the second occasion he was held for 15 days Tenakabon. He was acquitted of these charges. Anvar Moslami has also been arrested twice in the past on the same charge, in December 2008 and June 2009. One the first occasion he was sentenced to one year in prison, and on the second occasion he was acquitted",

	"description": "Milad Samimi Darzi ( میلاد صمیمی درزی ), who was in the fifth semester of a degree in interior design at Tabari University in the city of Babol (formerly known as Barforush), in Mazandaran province, has been expelled because of his Bahai beliefs. On January 1, he was summoned to the university’s security office where his student card was taken from him, and he was barred from the university premises. On January 5, two days before the end of term examinations, he was again summoned to the university security office where, after two hours of waiting in the vestibule, his expulsion from the university was communicated to him verbally. When he insisted on a more official statement and explanation, officials told him it was due to his bad attitude, and he was denied permission even to say farewell to his classmates. When he asked for the copies of his results, officials told him the pages would not have the stamp or signature of the university.\r\n\r\nShekufeh Derakhshaniyan ( شکوفه درخشانیان ), a student in the seventh semester of a Bachelor’s degree in interior design at Tabari University in Babol was expelled on January 5, because of her Bahai beliefs. As previously reported, a fellow-student, Milad Samimi Darzi ( میلاد صمیمی درزی ), who was in the fifth semester of the same course, was expelled on the same day. Shekufeh Derakhshaniyan received a summons from the head of university security on January 1, and when she went to the education department on January 5, she was informed that in accordance with a letter that the university had received, she and her cousin Milad Samimi Darzi were being expelled because of their Bahai beliefs, and that no written evidence of their expulsion would be provided, and their study results would not bear the university’s stamp or signature. She had been recognized as an outstanding student, with the highest grades among her fellow-students.\r\n\r\n",

The authorities not only confiscated his entire stock, valued at 2 billion rials (125,000 euros, 162,000 US dollars), he was fined 3.6 billion rials (225,000 euro, 293,000 US dollars) after a secret trial (trial in absentia)",

The shops taxes and fees have been paid, yet inquiries to the authorities have been fruitless. The relevant authorities have not provided any specific reasons, and say they are not responsible for the closures. Most of the businesses are cloth retailers. Under Iran’s religious apartheid system, Bahais are banned from working in many economic sectors, such as education, government employment and foodstuffs, but Bahai shopkeepers have been active in this economic sector for more than 20 years, without this being considered a trading violation. In recent years, and especially in recent months, numerous Bahai businesses in cities such as Semnan, Shiraz and Hamadan have been closed by the local authorities.",

Behfar has only been permitted a few days of leave from prison.\r\n\r\nBehfar’s sentence is being served for charges of membership of illegal Bahai groups, attending Bahá’í prayer meetings and the 19th day feast. Behfar’s arrest  occurred back on January 6th 2010 following a search of his home by Ministry of Intelligence agents. It is notable that Behfar was the target of two arson attacks upon his home.  He was among a group Bahá’ís who were pressured for interviews on television last December (see December 2012 report). During Behfar’s incarceration his wife and sister were also interrogated. \r\n",

	"description": "66-year old Riaz Sobhani, currently in prison for financially assisting the Baha’i Institute of Higher Education (BIHE), was refused medical leave after his recent heart surgery. His son, Naim Sobhani, told the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran that his father was transferred to the hospital for his surgery in chains.\r\n\r\nNaim Sobhani told the Campaign that two days after his surgery, his father was transferred back to Rajaee Shahr prison on 27 May, after being denied medical furlough.\r\n\r\nIn June 2011 authorities arrested Riaz Sobhani and on 30 September 2011 Judge Moghisseh of Branch 28 of Tehran’s Revolutionary Court sentenced him to four years in prison for providing financial assistance to BIHE. An appeals court upheld his sentence.\r\n\r\nSobhani’s son described his father’s experience in the hospital: “They transferred a sick 66-year-old man to the hospital with chains on his hands and feet. Three agents are watching him in the hospital around the clock and the family were only able to see my father a few times after imploring and begging the guards.”\r\n\r\nOn 13 May, authorities transferred Sobhani to prison because of his deteriorating medical condition. “My father’s left hand has lost all feeling, his hearing is impaired, and he has chronic coughing. These are symptoms he has developed over the past year in prison,’ said Naim Sobhani. “He previously had heart, vision, and stomach problems which were exacerbated by the poor hygienic and nutrition conditions in prison. We had asked the authorities twice to transfer him to a hospital, but they refused. But on 13 May his condition deteriorated to the point where they had to transfer him to a hospital. Prison staff called my mother and told her they had transferred him to the hospital and my family went there immediately.”\r\n\r\nRiaz Sobhani was a key member of the Baha’i Assembly in Tehran prior to its closure in 2008 when seven Baha’i community leaders were arrested and later each sentenced to 10 years in prison. Riaz Sobhani’s first lawyer, Abdolfattah Soltani, is currently in prison.",

	"description": "After several false starts on April 16 and 17 (reported earlier), the trial of `Adnan Rahmat-Penah ( عدنان رحمت‌پناه ), a Bahai from Shiraz, was rescheduled for April 29. When he arrived at the court, Judge Sadati postponed the trial for four hours. At 1 p.m. the judge entered the court, just as the call to prayer sounded, so he left again to attend attend the prayers. After the prayers, the judge told Mr. Rahmat-Penah’s lawyer that there was not sufficient time to deal with the case that day, so the trial would be delayed until the following day. It was notable that, when Mr. Rahmat-Penah and a political prisoner entered the courtroom, the judge — who was under the impression that they were Christian converts — began to insult them. Mr. Rahmat-Penah’s lawyer pointed out that the charges against them were quite different.\r\n\r\nOn April 30 Mr. Rahmat-Penah appeared in court at 11:30. The judge insulted his religious beliefs, directly and indirectly, and said he was “unclean,” according to the Quran, and told his lawyer that one should not shake hands with them. The lawyer responded that Bahais are human too, and added, “To me, humanity is important.” The judge replied, “Although this matter has been mentioned, we will judge everyone equally.” However the judge continued with his insults, directed not only at the defendant but at all the Bahais, saying, “You Bahais are all animals, only Muslims have the correct beliefs, and then only the twelver Shiahs.” After two hours, the judge finally turned to the case, and finding that Mr. Rahmat-Penah was one of 15 people arrested two years previously, whose cases were being handled by another judge, in courtroom 3, he sent the case there. That trail is not scheduled until late July. Mr. Rahmat-Penah and his family are left in suspense again.",

The charges were “organising and running an illegal organisation, membership of an illegal organisation, and propaganda against the regime.” They were among about 20 Bahais who were detained in a wave of arrests on about October 17. (Kourush Ziari is from Gonbad-e Qabus, where he was arrested and later transferred to Gorgan). After some weeks in detention in Gorgan, all seven were transferred to Evin prison in Tehran for interrogation, after which they were sent to Raja’i Shahr prison.",

Actually, they are waiting for the verdict, but this is Iran and they are Bahais, so in fact the question is, how long will they be in prison? A four-day flower and shrub exhibition was held in Mashhad from May 15, and the two sisters took part. They were assigned a booth, but on the first night of the exhibition the management cut off their electricity. Initially the reason given was “bad hejab,” but when they followed up on this they were told the orders had come from “above” (meaning the Army or Ministry of Intelligence), but they were not given any judicial order or written evidence of the decision. They were later asked to withdraw from the exhibition, which they refused. They continued their work, using candles and the light from neighbouring stalls. At the end of the exhibition, the management agreed to refund half of their exhibition fee.\r\n\r\nOn a lighter note: the PCED reports that Navid Khanjani (نوید خانجانی) has been allowed to meet his family for 20 minutes.",

	"description": "There are numerous Bahais in prison in Semnan, including women with small babies and. in the men’s wing, some Bahais who have serious illnesses. Despite the help given by the General Manager of prisons in Semnan province, Mr. Arab, and the promise that prison furloughs would be granted to prisoners without regard to their personal beliefs, and despite the cooperation of the head of Semnan’s central prison and other prison authorities there, to allow prison furloughs for Bahai prisoners, Mr. Haydar Asyabi ( حیدر آسیابی ), the Provincial Attorney, has refused to allow it. He has even refused Bahais early release at the end of their prison terms. At the Now Ruz holidays, even Bahai prisoners whose medical records were presented, with a recommendation for therapeutic furlough, were denied any leave. In each case, reference is made to the Medical Officer for the prison, Mr. Shateri ( شاطری ) who has knowingly contributed to the oppression of the Bahai community in Semnan. He is responsible for treating all the illnesses in the prison, and the Attorney has relied on his opinion in refusing leave to the prisoners. However the prison regulations specify that it is the Provincial Attorney who is responsible. In some cases, the medical conditions of Bahai prisoners have been exacerbated by lack of timely treatment. The Provincial Attorney’s duties and freedom to act are very broad, and prison regulations and the criminal procedure stress the importance of the physical and mental health of prisoners, which raises the question of why Mr. Asyabi has not used this power to grant leave to the Bahai prisoners? Why has he participated in the oppression of the Bahais, without regard for the rules and principles of Human Rights?\r\n\r\nUpdate, May 27: IOPHRI reports that Sufi prisoners in Evin prison are being refused medical treatment, unless they can obtain permission from the Ministry of Intelligence.",

He was put in touch with Mossad and sent to Israel for intelligence and military training, before going to Iran to spy for Mossad. Then he went to the Indian subcontinent and “met with two heads of the Zionist espionage operation, the Baha’is” and established contacts and coordinated with them. His next step was supposed to be to arrange terrorist attacks on June 14, election day. What a great way for a spy to stay undercover.\r\n\r\nSo why did have to go to India to contact Bahais? Are there no Bahais left in Iran? If he as trained in Israel, couldn’t he just hop on the train to Haifa and ring the bell?",

However, the Prosecutor for Mashhad, the judge overseeing prison and the Mashhad branch of the Ministry of Intelligence have opposed this treatment. Rozita Vaseghi has also been deprived of the right to furlough, although she has now served almost three years of her sentences. This is not the only case in which Bahai prisoners in Mashhad have been deprived of their legally established rights. [See the report of February 21, 2013, that Bahai prisoners in Mashhad have been denied the normal furlough, because of opposition from the Ministry of Intelligence.]",

He was arrested on March 14, 2011, and charged with participation in the 19th-day feast and membership of the Bahai community. He was separately charged with propaganda against the regime. Initially he was sentenced to four and a half years in prison (on May 24, 2011) which was reduced by the review court to 4 years: three years for being a Bahai and one year for propaganda against the regime. He was held in Amol prison for one year before being transferred to Babol. He suffered from health problems and very poor conditions during his detention, and was denied the usual prison furlough.",

He was receiving medical treatment before his imprisonment, but it has not been possible to continue this in prison. His family send medicines to the prison, but they are not always passed to him by the prison. Although he needs surgery for his sciatic problem, as he has lost all feeling in his left foot, the prison doctor has not recognized that this is necessary. He was arrested by the Ministry of Intelligence in Shiraz on July 14, 2012, and after almost 9 months in detention was sentenced, in May 2013, on the charges of “propaganda against the regime” and “membership in Baha’i organizations.",

	"description": "[Update, December 21. Reports indicate that the film crew concerned also attempted to persuade other Bahais, not mentioned in this report, to participate. A fuller report in English was published by Rooz on December 21]\r\n\r\nUpdate: August 9 2013\r\nSiamak Iqani (سیامک ایقانی ), a Bahai from Semnan, has been released from prison at the end of this three-year sentence for “propaganda against the regime and Bahai propaganda\r\n\r\nAfshin Iqani, Siamak Iqani, Behfar Khanjani and `Erfan Ehsani ( افشین ایقانی، سیامک ایقانی، بهفر خانجانی و عرفان احسانی ) who are serving their sentences in Semnan prison, were pressured by agents from the Ministry of Intelligence for more than four hours on December 4 to give “interviews” for television. They were taken to the prayer room at Semnan prison at 8 a.m. Officers who claimed to be representing the judicial authorities initially asked the four to speak to them in front of television cameras. When they refused, the officers said they were reporters from a national news network (Seda o Sima) and pressured them severely for four hours to speak in front of television cameras. Then the four, who have medical records showing they suffer from physical ailments and heart complaints, were taken to the prison’s clinic for monitoring. Afshin Iqani suffered a heart attack there. They were threatened with transfer to the Ministry of Intelligence detention facilities in Semnan, where false confessions would be forced from them by severe pressure, solitary confinement, beating and abuse. Political and religious prisoners in Semnan Prison are at the mercy of the presiding judge, Ruhollah Esmaili ( روح الله اسماعیلی ) who makes their conditions very harsh.\r\n\r\nAfshin Iqani is serving a sentence of 4 years and 3 months on charges of acting against national security, and has served 17 months of his sentence. Siamak Iqani is serving a 3 year sentence for propaganda against the regime and teaching the Bahai Faith, and has already served 25 months of his sentence. Behfar Khanjani is serving a 4 year sentence for membership of illegal Bahai groups and attending Bahai prayer meetings and the 19th-day ‘Feast.’ He has served 20 months of his sentence. `Erfan Ehsani is serving a one-year sentence for propaganda against the regime and acting against national security, and has served one month of his sentence. The prosecutor for Semnan province has prevented them being granted leave from prison, or better conditions.\r\n\r\n[The photograph caption provided by the PCED calls Erfan Ehsani, `Ali Ehsani, and the Persian report uses both names. So far as I know, Erfan Ehsani is the correct name, so it is possible that the photograph shown is of the wrong prisoner. ~ Sen]",

In Iranian law, being in prison is one of the circumstances under which absence from military service is permitted. \r\n\r\nSama Nourani was accepted for a course in medical engineering at Sahand University in Tabriz in October 2008, but was expelled after three semesters because of his Bahai beliefs. At that time, his name was sent to the authorities responsible for granting exemption from military service. He was arrested on March 2, 2010, along with Navid Khanjani and Iqan Shahidi. ",

Rosam Nik-Ain, a 12-month old child, was in prison with his mother, Zahra Nik-Ain, and was recently transferred to the Emir al-Mumenin hospital on 18 December 2012. He was suffering from a severe ear infection and fever. Nik-Ain repeatedly asked for a furlough so that she could treat her child, however her request was denied. She was later escorted by prison guard for two brief visits to the hospital. A recent report on 2 January 2013 indicates that Nik-Ain was given five days to spend with her son. She currently serves a 23-month sentence for the charge of “propaganda against the regime,” “participating in the Bahá’í ‘19th-day feast’”, participating in Ruhi classes and organizing morality classes for Bahá’í children.\r\n\r\nOn 26 December 2012 Barman Ehsani, the 6-month old child of Taraneh Torabi who currently imprisoned in Semnan, was taken to the Fatemiyyeh hospital to be treated for a lung infection. Torabi is serving a 30-month prison sentence for “propaganda against the regime” and participation in Bahá’í activities\r\n",

	"description": "Mithaq Imam Verdi ( میثاق امام وردی ) a Bahai student of Computer Science at the K.N.Toosi University of Technology in Tehran, has been expelled because of his “adherence to the Bahai Faith.” About two weeks before the final examinations of his first Bachelor’s year, he was summoned to the University’s security office, and was later told indirectly that he had been expelled. Only after he had gone to the university’s Director of Security was he told that he had been expelled because of his Bahai beliefs. However staff at the University’s central office described this as “bizarre and illogical.”\r\n\r\n[Iran's official propaganda denies that Iran operates an apartheid system. In November 2011, the head of Iran's judiciary, Mohammad Javad Larijani, claimed \"you can find Bahai’s in universities as students as teachers. There are more than 300 Baha’i students in universities. They are professors. They are very affluent people; they have big factories and companies.\" Thus the staff of the university office may have been genuinely unaware of the policy to deny Bahais access to tertiary education.]\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, Mithaq’s sister, Mina Imam Verdi ( مینا امام وردی ), was expelled for the same reason from Zanjan University, where she was in the third semester of a degree in agriculture.",

HRANA reports that be participated in the University Entrance examination this year, and got as far as the first stage of admission to a study programme, but on September 11, as he was entering his personal data in the site of the Department of Assessments, he was confronted with the error message “file incomplete.” For the past seven years, the “incomplete file” error message has been used to exclude known Bahai students from entering a university. However Ja`far Towfiqi (جعفر توفیقی), who was Minister of Science in President Khatami’s cabinet from 2003 to 2005. and who has been serving as acting Minister of Science, Research and Technology since August 17, 2013, has recently announced a programme of improvements and political opening for the universities. He has said that those excluded from education in recent years and who feel their rights have been infringed should take their cases to the Ministry of Science. President Rouhani has also promised, during the Presidential elections, that the problem of some people being excluded from higher education would be solved. The Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution, on the other hand, has stated that only Muslims, Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians are entitled to higher education.\r\n\r\nThe author and film maker Muhammad Nourizad ( محمد نوری زاد ), who was once a writer for the hard-line Keyhan newspaper, has written a letter protesting the exclusion of Bahai students using the “incomplete file” ruse. He states that an official from the Ministry of Science had told him that the Ministry of Intelligence had recently caused the exclusion of about 30 eligible Bahai students.",

Following this action, he was called to the Tehran Governor’s office in Abbas Abad and Mir Emad streets and was subjected to beating and injury.\r\n\r\nSomeone close to this Baha’i citizen told the Harana reporter: “Behzad Shokuhi was confronted with indecent curses, beating and injury at the Governor’s office and has been warned not to purse the matter any further.”\r\n\r\nHe continued: “All over his body there are bruises and signs of beating and injury. There was no point in encouraging him to go to the medical examiner’s office and launching a complaint, because apart from being warned about his pursuing the case, he has been looking after his wife who has been afflicted with Alzheimer’s disease for the past few years.”",

	"description": "Yesterday, three Bahai men were transferred from Tonekabon to the Ministry of Intelligence detention facilities in Sari, 225 kilometers to the East. Both cities are on the coastal plain of the Caspian Sea, in the north of Iran. Those arrested are Zayullah Qadri (ضیاءالله قادری), Soroush Gorshasebi (سروش گرشاسبی) and Faramarz Lotfi ( فرامرز لطفی). The report does not indicate when they were arrested, but implies it was on the same day. When Mr. Qadri’s wife, son, daughter and daughter-in-law entered the offices of Ministry of Intelligence to find out what had happened, and why, they were brutally assaulted by officials. When the family tried to stand up to them, the officials tried to drag the daughter-in-law outside by beating her and kicking her in the side, and when that failed, by pointing a gun at her. When she still refused to leave, tear gas and a pepper spray in their faces were used to eject her and her husband.",

It is not known where she is being held.\r\n\r\nOn April 18, Intelligence agents and officers from the local government — some 30 officers in all — searched the album-binding workshop of Anis Moti`i ( انیس مطیعی ) in Qaemshahr. Because Mr. Moti`i was able to produce a license to operate, they had no excuse to close the business, and had to be satisfied with a search. They arrested Mr. Moti`i on the grounds that a private individual had complained about him.\r\n\r\nThe officers then went to the home of Mr. Moti`i’s father, the owner of the business. They searched it, and confiscated religious books and images. Soroush Moti`i ( سروش مطیعی ) — apparently a brother of Anis Moti`i — was also arrested, and another\r\nbrother, Amir Moti`i ( امیر مطیعی ) was severely beaten and abused because he asked to see a search warrant.\r\n\r\nAs previously report, Sahel Miri and his wife Raheleh ( ساحل و راحله میری ) were arrested at their home in Qaemshahr on the same day. Security forces searched their home, seizing a computer and religious books and took them away. Raheleh is pregnant. The couple’s whereabouts is still unknown.",

She is pregnant, and is being held in Qaemshahr jail. It appears that the main charge against her husband is that he married a Muslim girl (Sahel) and caused her to change her religion. Because the accusation has been denied, the Ministry of Intelligence agents have pressured the parents of Raheleh to lay a complaint of Bahai conversion activities against their son-in-law. [ The accusation is an emotionally charged one, as well there being a law in Iran against non-Muslim men marrying Muslim women. Please remember this couple and their families in your prayers. ]",

The Bahá’í parents objected to these claims and had an unexpected display of support from Muslim parents also present. The Bahá’í parents made complaints to the Office for Supervising Education (OSE) after which their children were quickly expelled on the following day. At the OSE the parents were told that Bahais have no right to speak of their religion in the presence of other parents. After the expulsion the parents went to the General Office for Supervising Education in Iran with no progress to the issue. The expulsion of the children was ultimately confirmed and the parents were instructed to enroll their children at another school.",

The homes that were searched belonged to Behnam Jannati, Hedayat Golshan, Thani Sadeqi, Dhekrullah Sadaqat, Seyyed Jawad Dana, Mahmud Seyadat, Firuz Rastegar, Rahmatullah Golshan, Farshid Rastegar, Nasr Muvaffaq, `Ali Baqari, Fatemeh Kan`ani-Faruzan, Rezaqoli Rastegar and Sorush Ranjebar ( بهنام جنتی، هدایت گلشن، ثانی صادقی، ذکرالله صداقت، سید جواد دانا، محمود سیادت، فیروز رستگار، رحمت الله گلشن، فرشید رستگار، ناصر موفق، علی باقری، فاطمه کنعانی(فروزان)، رضاقلی رستگار و سروش رنجبر ).\r\n\r\nThen one or more Bahais from each family were summoned for questioning, and asked to sign a pledge not to participate in illegal activities or to participate in Bahai activities except for the 19th-day Feast (the regular Bahai meeting for worship and community affairs). In addition, two young Bahais received special attention from the agents. Mr. Afshin Bulbulan (افشین بلبلان) has been travelling to Abadeh for some years, to care for his grandfather, who is not well, while Mehrzad Feruzan (مهرزاد فروزان) travels intermittently to Abadeh to see his mother. Mr. Bulbulan was asked to sign a pledge not to come to Abadeh to see his family any more. In addition to the raids on Bahai homes, a workshop belonging to Esma`il Feruzan (اسماعیل فروزان), which is the second floor of the home of his mother, Fatemeh Kan`ani, was sealed by the authorities. However it was not in use as Mr. Feruzan is seeking to move his work to another city. The government not only excludes Bahais from higher education, it makes it very difficult for them to find workplaces, or obtain licenses for small businesses.",

The report states that “[Iran’s] culturally relativistic positions on human rights result in broad restrictions on fundamental rights and limit who can enjoy those rights on the basis of gender, ethnicity, ideology, political opinion, religion or culture.” In a break with the past, the Iranian government has responded to a draft version of this report, and the Special Rapporteur has incorporated these responses in his final report.\r\n\r\nIn the section on the oppression of the Bahai community in Iran, the rapporteur notes “an escalating pattern of systematic human rights violations targeting members of the Baha’i community, who face arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment, national security charges for active involvement in religious affairs, restrictions on religious practice, denial of higher education, obstacles to State employment and abuses within schools.”\r\n\r\nThe Iranian government responds that “Baha’is enjoy all citizenship rights and that they are not expelled from universities or otherwise deprived of their rights on the basis of their beliefs.”",

	"description": "Navid Khanjani ( نوید خانجانی ), a Bahai civil rights activist who founded the PCED, an activists’ organisation which seeks to end discrimination in Iran’s education system, was taken from Raja’i Shahr prison to hospital, where he remained for some hours. He suffers from a number of chronic conditions, and a spinal disk herniation. The prison doctor has said that he needed three weeks of home rest without stress, to prevent the disk problem worsening to the point that surgery would be required. His condition worsened on October 21. He also suffers from a colon condition which requires surgery, and he is receiving medication for a heart condition.\r\n\r\nNavid Khanjani was arrested in March 2010 and spent about 2 months in prison before being released on bail. He was one of the 35 social activists who were arrested while bring aid to the victims of the 2011 Azerbaijan earthquake, but was later acquitted in that case. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison on charges of spreading propaganda, disturbing public opinion, propaganda against the regime in the reports and interviews of foreign media, membership of the central committee of the CHRR (Committee of Human Rights Reporters), and founding the PCED. He began serving this sentence, in Rajai Shahr prison, in September 2012. In March 2013 he was severely beaten by prison officers at Tehran’s Evin prison, where he had been taken for a court hearing.",

Their names are Soroush Gorshasebi, Sina Gorshasebi and Omid Qaderi ( سروش گرشاسبی، سینا گرشاسبی و امید قادری ). Mr. Gorshasebi was one of three Bahais arrested in Tonekabon on September 23 and taken to the Ministry of Intelligence detention facilities in Sari. He was freed on bail after 17 days in detention. Sina Gorshasebi, a Canadian citizen, was previously sentenced (September 2011) to six months in prison for leaving Iran without a permit. Omid Qaderi was previously arrested in October 2010, and the business he had at that time was closed down in February 2011, when he was fined about 300 euros. The reasons for the closure have not been announced. Because Bahais are believed to be “unlean” they are barred from selling food items to Muslims, but local authorities can extend this ban to cover numerous other items as well, as liquids are believed to convey “uncleanness” like a contagion. In some cases, florists shops run by Bahais have been closed on the argument that the plants are often wet when sold and could spread Bahai uncleanness.",

In the Islamic lunar calendar, November 16 and 17, 2012 were Muharram 1 and 2, when Bahais in countries using that calendar celebrate the births of the Bab and Baha’u'llah, and close their businesses\r\n\r\nThe business currently remained closed three months after the fact with no progress towards a solution made. Due to the degree of economic ostracism that the Bahá’í community faces in Iran, the community relies heavily on small service / retail businesses for their livelihood. \r\n",

She attended classes until one week before her expulsion, when university officials asked for her BA diploma and a few day later, contacted her by telephone to ask some questions about her religious beliefs. She was then told that she was barred from further study at the University.",

Nika and Nava Khalusi (نیکا و نوا خلوصی ) have had their sentences of six years and 4 and a half years in prison, respectively, confirmed. The sentence of Adib Sho`a`i (ادیب شعاعی) was reduced from 18 months to six months, and the sentence of Mahsa Mahdavi was reduced from eight months to three months and one day. All four were charged with membership of the Bahai organisation, participation in illegal Bahai activities, and propaganda in favour of the Bahais and against the regime of the Islamic Republic.\r\n\r\nUpdate: March 25th 2014\r\nLeva Khanjani ( لواء خانجانی ), a Bahai serving a two-year sentence in Evin prison, has been granted furlough for Naw Ruz. Leva Khanjani is a student excluded from education because of her Bahai beliefs. She was arrested on January 3, 2010, along with her husband Babak Mobasher, on the pretext that they had participated in street protests following the 2009 elections.",

The Mousavis believe that the perpetrator thought they were all sleeping in the hut when he set the fire. Mr. Mousavi issued a formal complaint against the person they suspected, but the legal office has declined to pursue the case because the suspect swore on the Qur’an that he was not guilty. Out of respect for the Qur’an, the Mousavis have dropped the charges.",

	"description": "Since July, 2011, officials have been preventing the Bahais of Tabriz from washing the bodies of their loved ones, and from using coffins in their burial. Following the death of Fatemeh Zara’i (فاطمه سلطان زارعی), officials at the Wadi Rahmat cemetery in Tabriz announced that it was not permissible to wash the body, or to use a coffin for her burial — both of which are part of Bahai burial practices — and that they would not allow her to be buried. This is despite the fact that the Bahais shared in the cost of construction and maintenance of the cemetery, and had previously been buried there alongside others, without any problems. The Bahais of Tabriz have sought redress with officials at all levels, including the Municipality, the Friday Prayer leader, the cemetery’s administrators, the committee for sects and religions, the Mayor, the office of the Supreme Leader, the President of the IRI and members of parliament, but all have refused to consider the matter.\r\n\r\nFollowing the death of one young Bahai, Sabet Muhammadi (ثابت محمدی), his family was told they should hand over his body, and that a burial place would be found by noon, [thus denying the family an opportunity to wash and prepare the body according to Bahai law.] In 11 previous cases, bodies were buried without being washed, and without coffins, in the town of Miandoab, about 160 km south of Tabriz. Bahai teachings do not allow either moving a body long distances for burial (more than one hour’s travel), or burying the body of a Bahai in ways contrary to the Bahai burial rites.",

	"description": "On January 25, Hadjabr Firuzeyan (هژبر فیروزیان) reported to Semnan prison to begin serving a 40-day sentence. He is the father of Golrokh and Shidrokh Firuzeyan (شیدرخ و گلرخ فیروزیان), who began serving 6-month sentences in Semnan prison on January 8, 2014. His name has also been reported as Hadjir Firuzeyan (هژیر فیروزیان) and on this blog as Hadjbar Firuzeyan. He complained of the physical abuse of Golrokh by a Ministry of Intelligence interrogator. During one of her interrogations, the interrogators were harsh. One interrogator stood behind her and pulled her against the back of the chair, leaving her with severe back pains and a bleeding nose. Mr. Firuzeyan informed the officer handling the case, the Prosecutor and the Chief Justice. When there was no response from them, he wrote to the President of Iran, detailing the treatment of his daughter, and also tried to present this letter to the President when he was visiting Semnan. [From the dates, it would appear this refers to President Rouhani, who promised that human rights would be respected in Iran but has not been able to improve the situation at all.] Mr. Firuzeyan was arrested by the Ministry of Intelligence and held in solitary confinement for some time. He was later fined 12 million rials (350 euros, $US 480), which was confirmed on appeal, for defaming the head of the Semnan office of the Ministry of Intelligence, Mohammad Reza Hashemian (محمد رضا هاشمیان). He has chosen to serve 40 days in prison rather than pay the fine.",

	"title": "Sarang Ettehadi sentenced without trial: 5 years",
	"description": "Sarang Ettehadi, a Bahai from Tehran, has been sentenced to five years in prison on charges of “propaganda against the regime” and “membership in Bahai institutions.” An unusual aspect of the sentence is that Mr. Ettehadi had already been pardoned, and that the sentence was issued three days before the trial — which functioned only to inform the accused of his sentence.\r\n\r\nMr. Ettehadi was arrested was arrested in Tehran on June 27, 2012, in a wave of arrests in Tehran, Mashhad and Shiraz that netted almost 20 Bahais. He was among those pardoned for the Eid al-Fitr on August 15, 2012. Mr Ettehadi has written his own account of his conviction and sentencing, which has been translated by Dr. Nizam Missaghi:\r\n\r\nOn January 15, 2014, I appeared in the Revolutionary Court to meet the judge as ordered. However, upon my arrival, the Judge’s assistant, Mojtaba, told me that there would be no hearing for me on that day and that my sentence had already been issued in absentia three days prior to the scheduled court date. I reviewed the court document in disbelief and learned that I had been sentenced to five years in prison on charges of “propaganda against the regime” and “membership in Bahá’í institutions.”\r\n\r\nMy sentence was issued in absentia on January 12, 2014. However, my court date had initially been communicated as January 8 and had been postponed by the court to January 15, the date when I appeared in court. My attorney objected to the sentencing prior to the court date in absentia and insisted that we meet with the judge. After the urging of my counsel, we briefly met with the judge, who, without any hesitation or reasoning, re-read the same sentence to us and confirmed it had been issued.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that my initial charge had been “propaganda against the regime,” which carries a maximum one-year prison sentence. However, the judge had illegally annexed another charge to my file prior to issuing the five-year sentence as follows: “membership in an illegal organization in order to disturb national security.” The judge addressed me directly and said, “you participated in prayer gatherings and religious rituals with other Bahá’ís, which constitutes an organized and illegal activity.” However, I responded, the Iranian Constitution clearly protects the rights of religious minorities to assembly and worship. When I asked the judge to explain how saying prayers with friends would constitute “propaganda against the regime” or could “disturb national security,” he responded matter-of-factly, “the assembly of even two or three people is an organized activity and is against the law!”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, legal due process in Iran is lamentably defective. Minorities, ethnic or religious, and dissidents are typically at the mercy of a judge who can add to their charges as he wishes, choose to not communicate a change in the defendant’s court date, and sentence the defendant in absentia without proper time allotted for the defense to respond or even know of the charges. The sentencing and the outcome, by and large, are forgone conclusions, and the hearing, if it actually takes place, is nothing but a formality reminiscent of a show trial. The longer such defective judicial system is in place, the more lives will be ruined, youth will be lost, trust will be replaced with despair, and the future of our glorious Iran will be overshadowed with injustice.",

	"description": "In Birjand, a provincial capital close to Iran’s border with Afghanistan, a masked individual has entered the home of a Bahai family and brutally stabbed three of them. The attack occurred on February 3. Mr. Qodratullah Mu’adda (قدرت الله مودی) was stabbed in the abdomen and side, Mrs. Tubi Mu’adda (طوبی مودی) in the neck, close to the jugular vein, and ‘Azam Mu’adda (اعظم مودی) was stabbed in the chest. The assailant left the house without making any attempt to steal anything. Mr. and Mrs. Mu’adda are a middle-aged couple, living alone. Their daughter, who lives in Tehran, had arrived that morning on a visit.\r\n\r\nUpdate, February 7: The Bahai World News Service states that the family name is pronounced Mavadi rather than Mu’adda (the two words are spelt in the same in Persian), and that all three are in intensive care in hospital. Mr. Mavadi is a leading figure in the Bahai community in Birjand, and the BWNS concludes that this was religiously-inspired hate crime. ““The sad fact is that there have been more than 50 physical assaults on Iranian Baha’is since 2005 – and none of the attackers has been prosecuted or otherwise brought to justice. And at least nine Baha’is have been murdered under suspicious circumstances in the same period, and the murderers have likewise enjoyed impunity.",

The coroner determined that he had been killed three days earlier, that is, on April 21st, an important Bahai festival, that the door had been forcibly entered, and that nothing was stolen. A relative said that the house was full of blood, indicating that Mr. Aqdasi was alive when the seven blows were struck. His body was sent to the Coroner in Urumiyyeh, who stated that the Coroner’s office could not obtain a lawyer [a detective to deal with the case], since the officer responsible for Bahai cases was not present. Ten months have now passed, but no steps have been taken to investigate the murder.",

Nor was there any explanation of why, despite this close monitoring, no evidence of the supposed spying has emerged. ~ Sen]\r\n\r\nLast October, Dr. Ahmed Shaheed, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran, issued a report that included a section on the persecution of the Bahais.\r\n\r\nHe wrote, ”The special rapporteur continues to observe what appears to be an escalating pattern of systematic human rights violations targeting members of the Baha’i community, who face arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment, national security charges for active involvement in religious affairs, restrictions on religious practice, denial of higher education, obstacles to state employment and abuses within schools.”",

	"description": "n a speech to seminary students and teachers, Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi, an influential hardliner in the Iranian regime, stated “Some have come forward with a plan for citizenship rights and want to give equal rights to the Bahais and the Jews and the Muslims and… We can never accept this.” There was no doubt that he was referring to the Draft Citizenship Rights Charter presented by Rouhani’s administration last November.\r\n\r\nYazdi’s ire was directed at the principle that all citizens are equal under the law. “All Iranian citizens, regardless of their gender, ethnicity, wealth, social class, race, etc, enjoy citizenship rights and the foreseen guarantees in rules and regulations,” declares the draft charter’s first article. The sentence does not include the term “religion,” probably intentionally, but the “etc.” leaves a lot of room for speculation. Hardliners have been quick to speculate, especially when it comes to the Bahai community, which has been harassed relentlessly since the Islamic Revolution.\r\n\r\n“The standard is always Islam,” Yazdi told the theological school students. “Western human rights and citizenship rights, meaning equality between Muslims and Bahais, has no relation to Islam. These rights, as described by the West, utterly go against Islam, the constitution and the way of Imam [Ayatollah Khomeini]. The people of this country, who have suffered hardships and have given so many martyrs, would not accept anything that goes against Islam. Of course, even those who are not Muslims must be respected. They have rights, which Islam recognizes.”",

	"title": "Anti-Bahai demonstration planned for Tehran",
	"description": "Iran Press News, a usually reliable source, reports that an anti-Bahai demonstration was planned in Tehran. It was to take place in front of the United Nations offices in Tehran, on March 16. It is not clear whether the demonstration did take place there, or whether the authorities intervened. The belief that the United Nations, the BBC, human rights organisations and lawyers, the British government and other foreign organs are controlled by Bahais is a common feature of anti-Bahaism in Iran, but it seems unlikely that the authorities would welcome a public display of anti-Bahaism where it could be witnessed from the UN offices.\r\n\r\nA statement released by the demonstration’s organisers states that the “deviant sect of Bahais” is a terrorist organisation with its headquarters in the territories occupied by Zionism [Israel], and supported by the Zionist regime. It is linked to this illegal murderous regime which has shed the blood of thousands of innocent people. The actions of this deviant sect are not limited to physical acts of terrorism, they interfere systematically in the lives of the devotees, who are subjected to control from childhood, depriving them of freedom of conscience and the chance to investigate. Moreover, the sect subjects those who leave the sect and seek guidance [become Muslims] to the most inhumane possible treatment, ranging from character assassination to shunning.\r\n\r\nThe Bahai Faith is a religion founded in Iran in the 19th century, which functions democratically without any priesthood. The Ottoman authorities exiled its founder, Baha’u’llah, to Akka, where he died in 1892, approximately 50 years before Israel came into existence. In the early 20th century there was an appreciable Bahai community in various parts of what is now Israel, but as the future character of the state of Israel became evident, they were all asked to leave. Today there are no Bahais with a permanent residence in Israel, although there are a few hundred staff with temporary appointments working at the Bahai shrines there. The organisers’ “guilt by association” argument is not only logically invalid, it is factually wrong.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important Bahai teachings is the independent investigation of truth: children of Bahais are not automatically enrolled as Bahais, but may chose to enroll from the age of 15, if they wish. There is undoubtedly some separation, in Iran, between Bahais and those who have left the Bahai community to become Muslims. A long-standing fatwa, recently re-iterated by Ayatollah Khamene’i, states that good Muslims should avoid any contact with Bahais.",

Mr. Sobhani is serving a one-year prison term, and one of the other Bahais of Semnan has been running the business so that his family has the means of livelihood. Because of restrictions on Bahai employment and the economic sectors in which they may have businesses, a number of Bahais in Iran have opened to optician’s shops, but in recent years several of these have been closed. On November 29, 2012, another optician’s shop run by Mr. Akbar Por-hoseini ( اکبرپورحسینی ), a Bahai in Semnan, was raided. In that case, authorities not only confiscated his entire stock, valued at 2 billion rials (125,000 euros, 162,000 US dollars), he was fined 3.6 billion rials (225,000 euro, 293,000 US dollars) after a secret trial.",

It appears that the accusation of insulting Islam was raised by his neighbour, following a legal dispute regarding the use of a right of way.",

	"description": "\r\nAlliance for Rights of All Minorities-ARAM, June 13, 2014\r\n\r\nWashington D.C — The Alliance for Rights of All Minorities (ARAM) has been informed of the dissemination of an incendiary flyer in the city Yazd which states: “Since the Baha’i people are considered as expelled criminals by Islam, any privilege of life or property on their blood is wasted.” The flyer that was posted on targeted sections of the city, including the doors of some Baha’i residences calls for “all Moslems to oppose this group and to fight them with all their life.”\r\n\r\nThe dissemination of this flyer on the eve of Mid- Shaban, or Shabe-barat, or the “night of deliverance” which honors the birth Imam Mahdi, by design or coincidence presents a heightened threat, particularly as the world’s attention is focused on World Cup fervor and turmoil in Iraq. ARAM calls on Iran’s government officials to preserve the safety and security of its citizens by condemning the flyer and its message.\r\n\r\nJune 14. HRANA adds that anti-Bahai graffiti has also appeared in Yazd, on the walls and gates of Bahai houses. It is unimaginative: all the examples shown say “Death to the Bahais.” One adds “death to America and England.”\r\n \r\n\r\nSide note: The report of the Bahai World News Service on this incident states, “In January, said Ms. Alai, the Bahai International Community had catalogued at least 55 anti-Bahai articles on Iranian websites. That rose to 72 in February, 93 in March, 285 in April, and 366 in May.”",

The water fight in Aram Park was cancelled when the security \r\nforces threatened to disrupt it, but the event in Besat Park led to \r\nclashes with security forces.\r\nFarhud Yazdani, according to a relative, was not an organizer of \r\nthese events, but was one of those invited to join in.

May \r\nKhoolusi, Dori Amri and Shayan Tafazoli were arrested in the home of May\r\n Kholusi, and were at first held in Ministry of Intelligence \r\ninterrogation facilities in Mashhad. They were transferred to Vakilabad \r\nprison on August 2. Thus far the authorities have not given any specific\r\n reason for extending their detention. It would appear that Dari Amri \r\nand Shayan Tafazoli were initially arrested by accident, as there was no\r\n warrant for them, but after their arrest they were accused of \r\n“propaganda against the regime.”",

	"description": "A young woman who  placed 113th out of all Iranians – estimated to  who took college entrance examinations earlier this year was blocked from entering university  despite her high score, and her keen desire to learn, because of her Baha'i faith. \r\n Ms. Shirazi’s story sheds light on a new tactic adopted this year by the government to prevent young Iranian Baha’is from entering Iranian universities. The story of her injustice has also stirred the outrage of many Iranians, who have told and re-told it on more than two dozen Persian-language websites.\r\nThe new tactic involves an apparent effort by the government to deprive Baha’is of any document or paper that can be used to prove that they were denied access to higher education because of their religious beliefs. In recent years, for example, they were told that their files were “incomplete” when they tried to get college entrance examinations results. Whether flashed on a computer screen and printed out or delivered by letter, that message left a paper trail.This year, however, Baha’is like Ms. Shirazi are being told to go the local testing office for their results. There, often after considerable evasion and runaround, they are ultimately shown but not physically given papers that say only Muslims and “officially recognized minorities” are allowed to be accepted into university.\r\nSignificantly, they are also singled out as Baha’is, despite the fact that they never made any such indication on examination forms or other papers. Avoiding a paper trail is said to help avoid any concerns from the international community.",

According to Navid Aghdasi, despite the family’s insistence that this murder was ideologically motivated, the investigative judge insists on eliminating this motive and pushes the notion of suicide as Rezvani’s cause of death. Aghdasi added that the last person to see Rezvani alive has disappeared for the past 12 days and the family is concerned that Rezvani’s case may be forgotten in this time. Ataollah Rezvani, 52, was killed by a gunshot to the back of the head in his car on August 24. He was an active member of the Bandar Abbas Baha’i community and a charity worker. ",

	"description": "Susan Tebyanian, a Baha’i from Semnan, in 2005 wrote a letter directly to  then-President Khatami, toward the end of his presidential tenure, openly lamenting of injustices against Baha’is. Because of this action, Mrs. Tebyanian was arrested, accused of making propaganda against the government, and subsequently sentenced to a 91 day term, which was suspended.\r\nIn the beginning of 2009, she was again arrested. Mrs. Tebyanian spent five days under interrogation and was confined in solitary confinement. During this period her 18 month-old daughter, Soha Jaberi, was in her prison cell with her.\r\nAfter interrogation, in court under presiding Judge Zangui, she was convicted to 18 months of incarceration and sent to Evin prison. During a revision of her case, she was accused, when teaching Baha’i morals classes, of working against the government. This caused her initial convictions to be confirmed, which became evidence for her initial conviction. Mrs. Tebyanian completed her prison term in 2010-2011.On 31st May 2014, she was arrested again at her residence by agents of the Ministry of Information,  interrogated for 45 days under enormous pressure to confess to the same accusations.On 7th August 2014, she was sentenced to one year of prison at a hearing in a court under presiding Judge Amiri, which took only 45 minutes.At present her defence counsel, Mr. Mazdak Etemadzade, a human rights lawyer, is preparing documentation for another appeal. Mrs. Tebyanian has two children, aged seven and twelve, and is anxious and worried about their psychological well-being.",

Ms. Mithaqi’s name has also been reported as Noushin Aghdasi. They were accused of “propaganda against the regime.” Not long ago they received telephone calls saying they should report to the prison, but did not do so as no official summons followed. They are among seven Baha’is in Urmia who were sentenced early in July this year to terms ranging from six months to six years, on charges that included teaching the Bahai Faith, propaganda against the Islamic Republic, hosting teaching classes in their homes, teaching minors, attracting Muslims, membership of a Bahai Assembly, and having links to the Universal House of Justice.",

It is understood that \"market saturation\" has only been used in the cases of Baha'is. Clearly the government is disallowing Baha'is in some cities to own certain types of business on the grounds that too many Baha'is are engaged in it. Arrested were shop owners Aladdin (Niki) Khanjani and Babak Mobasher, along with three employees, Naser Arshi-Moghaddam, Ataollah Ashrafi and Rouhollah Monzavi. Mr. Khanjani is the son of Jamaloddin Khanjani, one of the seven Baha'i leaders who are currently serving 20 year prison sentences on false charges including espionage.Agents also confiscated their computers and other electronic devices and took a large amount of goods and products from their shop.A sixth employee, who is not a Baha'i, was also arrested but then released that afternoon.",

They searched the house, and arrested Mr. Rastegar and the others present, who were all students of the Bahai Open University (BIHE). Mr. Rastegar has been helping students in the Abadeh area who are studying at the Bahai Open University, an institution designed to offer tertiary courses in certain subject to students who are excluded from licenced universities in Iran because of their religious beliefs. The youth who were arrested on December 29 were released next day, but Mr. Rastegar was held for two days, and was questioned mainly about the Bahai Open University.",

According to the Baha'i International Community in Geneva, the burial of \"Shamel Bina\", who died on October 28, was prevented despite requests from the family and others to several officials including the governor and the city's imam.The report adds that the Baha'i cemetery in the city of Ahwaz has been recently closed by the authorities in a cruel manner; the cemetery's entrance door is welded shut and a wall has been built in front of it.\r\nThe Baha'i International Community asserts that this incident is the latest in a series of events in recent months that the Iranian authorities have done to prevent the burial of Baha'is, or have interfered in it, or issued permits for the destruction of their cemeteries. It seems that these cases are part of an organized campaign to force Baha’is to deny their religious identity.\r\nIn the city of Semnan, the Baha'is have been told that they must sign a disclaimer for the issuance of a burial permit for their relatives. On these forms it is stated that on the grave nothing except name and date of birth can be written and no green space is created. Similar instructions were issued earlier this year about the Baha'i cemetery in Sangsar.The report pointed to other cases of rights violations against Baha'is in Iran, including the following:\r\nIn Tabriz, local authorities, for at least 8 days, refused to issue a burial permit for a woman in the Baha’is cemetery of Tabriz unless she is buried without a coffin, which is contrary to the funeral rituals of the Baha'is.Also in November, state officials closed down the Baha'i cemetery in Mahmoudieh, Esfahan, and stated that the Baha'is are not allowed to be buried at the site. During a period of eight months in Tabriz, the burial of at least 15 Baha'is has been prevented in the public cemetery, and families were forced to send the bodies of their loved ones to other cities.According to the report dated October 2014 of Ahmad Shaheed, the UN Special Rapporteur of Human Rights in Iran, at least 126 Baha'is are in prison as of August 2014. The Baha'i International Community and leaders of the Anglican Church of Iran added that many lawyers who have accepted the sensitive cases of Baha'is or Christians have either been imprisoned or have fled the country. The destruction or closing of religious places like cemeteries, worship centres and churches continues. In May 2014, despite the demands of human rights societies and groups, the Revolutionary Guards of the Islamic Republic destroyed a Baha'i cemetery in Shiraz. Ban Ki-moon, the UN Secretary General, in his report on September 12 of last year said that the promises of President Hassan Rouhani of the Islamic Republic of Iran regarding more freedom have not led to any noticeable improvement in human rights and freedom of expression. The United Nations General Assembly on December 18, 2014 for the sixty-first time condemned the Iranian regime for its human rights violations, the high number of executions and the repression of minorities.",

	"description": "Noora Mossama, a student majoring in Computer Software Engineering at the State University of Mazandaran, was dismissed at the end of her first semester. According to the findings of reporters of the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), a news organization covering all human rights activities in Iran, Noora Mossama, a Computer Software Engineering student at the State University of Mazandaran, was denied access to attend her final exam at the end of her first semester. An informed source in this case told the HRANA reporter: “Noora Mossama, despite filling the Religious Affiliation column honestly, was nevertheless admitted; however, after studying for a semester she was labeled an ‘unqualified student’ when she tried to obtain her online exam-entrance card to take her final test at the end of the semester.”  He added: “As a result, she was denied access to the exam site. After many follow-ups with the Admission Office and the Office of the Dean of the University, it became apparent that she had not been given clearance by the Office of Protection and Security of the University.”",
